QtOpenCL
--------
Forked from https://gitorious.org/qtopencl-clone/qtopencl-clone/ and modified a little: it builds on windows with Qt5.2 and MinGW 4.8
--------

This directory contains a Qt-style wrapper library for OpenCL
plus several examples, benchmarks, and unit tests that exercise
the library in various ways.

See "doc/src/building.qdoc" for build instructions.
