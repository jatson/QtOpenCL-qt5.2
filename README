QtOpenCL
--------
Cloned from https://gitorious.org/qtopencl-clone/qtopencl-clone/ and modified a little: it can be compiled on windows instantly
--------

This directory contains a Qt-style wrapper library for OpenCL
plus several examples, benchmarks, and unit tests that exercise
the library in various ways.

See "doc/src/building.qdoc" for build instructions.
